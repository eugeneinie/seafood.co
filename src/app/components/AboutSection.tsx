            <p> We know that during COVID-19, a lot of folks around the city and state are feeling uneasy about the future - we’re not sure what the future holds either.</p>

            <p>That said: we know that we love making sure you have the gear you need for your adventures, and we’re going to keep doing that - with our team - until the city tells us we can’t.</p>

            <p>But as long as folks like yourself support small businesses around the city, then we’ll be here — every day, making sure your orders arrive on time.</p>

            <p>-------</p>
